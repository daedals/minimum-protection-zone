# The minimum protection zone is 1K

This is a public repository showing my results of a coding challenge. It is a vue-app using vuetify. The exact details of this challenge were intentionally held vague.

## Important Links

The web-app is hostet [here](https://daedals.github.io/minimum-protection-zone/).

## Challenge

Given a .json containing 3 arrays with a number of coordinates (in m) describing a robot, a gadget and a path: 
- Calculate the length of the path in m,
- Calculate the time it takes the robot to cover the distance of that path while its speed abides to given rules,
- Calculate the area the gadget covers during the robots travel.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
